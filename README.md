# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of the application is to create a functioning web app that lets you see courses offered at brown. The value of the app is that is tells the user all the basic necessary information about the app.

### Usability Principles Considered
The main usability principle I considered was varying font size. It clearly shows what is a header or a section title.

### Organization of Components
Each component consists of the class number, name, deparment, time, minutes per week, enrollment number, professor, and a picture of a professor. These are listed vertically in each component. Then there is an add to cart button and a remove from cart button.

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Data is passed down through components as props. It is passed in sort of like parameters when the component is made in the App function, then in the component funciton it uses the 'props' keyword to call on and use whatever data was passed in.

### How the User Triggers State Changes
The user triggers state changes in various ways. Whenever they decide to filter or sort there is a state change. Additionally, whenever they add or removed from cart.
